HiSlain - Static Blog Publishing System

An extensible (Plugins! Themes!) Blog Publishing System I wrote so I could move http://yuvisense.net off Wordpress. It's written in Python, uses Jinja2 for templating (themes), various markup schemes for markup (there's a markdown plugin, rolling your own should be a 15 minute job), and I publish via a github repo[http://yuvisense.net] (use whatever means you want(FTP/RSYNC))

TODO:

1. Write a better README
2. Cleanup code
3. More plugins!
4. More themes!
5. Profile code
